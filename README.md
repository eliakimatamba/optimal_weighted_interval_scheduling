# optimal_weighted_interval_scheduling
##
The code is a function that takes an input of the number of jobs and then prints out the maximum value.
The code starts by sorting all the jobs in order from smallest to largest, which is done with cmp().
Then it sets up a vector for each job and initializes them with their weight.
It also creates an array called dp that will be used to store the results of the max() function.
The main part of this program is solving, which is where it iterates through every job in its list and calculates their maximum value.
The code attempts to solve the problem of finding the maximum value in a vector.
The code starts by sorting the vector of jobs using cmp() function.
Then, it stores the first and last values of each job in dp[] array.
The next step is to find out which job has the highest weight and store that value in ans variable
